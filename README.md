# ModusToolbox™ Software Training Level 1 Getting Started

This is the entry-level ModusToolbox™ training class. It is a pre-requisite for all level 2 and level 3 ModusToolbox™ training classes.

This class is a survey of the ModusToolbox™ development platform. The learning objective is to introduce you to all the tools in the ModusToolbox™ ecoysystem and help you develop some familiarity with using them. The class is “a mile wide and an inch deep.” This should enable you to understand the scope of the development ecosystem and teach you where to find “everything.”

This is a "Level 1" class, which means that it is intended as an entry point to get you started with the ModusToolbox™ ecosystem. Level 2 classes dig deeper to give more detailed training on specific products such as PSoC™ or XMC MCUs. Level 3 classes go even further by diving into a complete solution such as Bluetooth®, Wi-Fi, Motor Control, or Machine Learning.

## Pre-requisites

- None

## Organization

- *Manual*:    This directory contains the manual chapters.
- *Projects*:  This directory contains solutions to exercises.

## Manual Chapters

This class consists of two chapters:
- Chapter 1: Introduction - Overall introduction to the ModusToolbox™ ecosystem
- Chapter 2: Tools - Detailed description of how to use each tool and software asset

## Hardware

The following hardware is used for the exercises in this class:

- CY8CKIT-062S2-43012 (PSoC™ 62S2 Wi-Fi BT Pioneer Kit)

As a less exspensive alternative, the following kit can be used:

- CY8CPROTO-062-4343W (PSoC™ 62 Wi-Fi BT Prototyping Kit)

*The prototyping kit doesn't have an Auduino expansion header and does not have as many user buttons or LEDs so it does not provide as much functionality as the Pioneer kit.*

## Videos

Videos are available for many of the topics from this class. See the list below for a link to each video.

This video showcases installation on Windows in addition to providing details for installing on macOS and Linux operating systems. |
| [Documentation](https://e.video-cdn.net/share?video-id=1CAThWybQvb4TC5SgW-7_r&player-id=2t2W2ykrDB_RisZ1QorEJU&channel-id=89141) | Quick and easy access to documenation is a key attribute to working with a development environment like ModusToolbox™. In this video we'll highlight how to access some of the key documentation resources and where to find additional community support. |
| [Creating an application](https://e.video-cdn.net/share?video-id=9U66xSrFnnE4CBv77be2yx&player-id=2t2W2ykrDB_RisZ1QorEJU&channel-id=89141) | Infineon provides a large number of code examples and project templates within Infineon GitHub repositories. This video provides an overview of how to work with the ModusToolbox™ Project Creator to create an application on your development machine. Topics cover using the stand-alone graphical Project Creator, an integrated flow within the Eclispe IDE for ModusToolbox™, and how to use the command-line interface to create projects in a scriptable way. |
| [Exploring an application](https://e.video-cdn.net/share?video-id=5NozBTozrJVSHmCK5Gj5Ys&player-id=2t2W2ykrDB_RisZ1QorEJU&channel-id=89141) | Now that your ModusToolbox™ application has been created, this video will explore the folder structure. We'll cover the location of Board Support Package files, shared libraries, and ModusToolbox™ workflow files. Our goal is to help demystify how the various files are used and enable the developer to take full advantage of the flexibility provided by the ModusToolbox™ development environment. |
| [Working with the command line](https://e.video-cdn.net/share?video-id=DgUU1RU5KBnPrQmRvHh1g_&player-id=2t2W2ykrDB_RisZ1QorEJU&channel-id=89141) | In this video we'll discuss and walk through using the command-line interface supported by ModusToolbox™. This video covers the many features and commands that are available within the ModusToolbox™ make-based build system. |
